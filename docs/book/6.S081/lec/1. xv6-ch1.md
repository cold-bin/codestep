# Chapter 1 Operating system interfaces

The job of an operating system is to share a computer among multiple programs and to provide a more useful set of services than the hardware alone supports. 



An operating system manages and
abstracts the low-level hardware, so that, for example, a word processor need not concern itself
with which type of disk hardware is being used. An operating system shares the hardware among
multiple programs so that they run (or appear to run) at the same time. Finally, operating systems
provide controlled ways for programs to interact, so that they can share data or work together.
