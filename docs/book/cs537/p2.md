[Music] hello hello hello hello

[Music] can you hear me

can you hear me

that is the nature of the world that is why it's nice to be here in person yes

what a strange year we've had year plus it's been bad for everyone i'm glad that

you're back thank you okay so let's just do this part quickly

um we've talked about two things we're

going to talk about virtualization which kind of made sense

is this too loud

no life's perfect

okay i like whoever said that a plus so virtualization part one part one of the

course concurrency super confusing simple programs don't

work part two part three

is going to be what we call persistence

and i won't talk too much about that today but what we'll we'll give you a

preview we already gave you a preview it's that

part about storing information persistently that means

by the way i guess i didn't quite define that

when i found out when you power it off the data doesn't

go away you power off your vray your data goes away when you power off

your hard drive or your flash mixed ssd the bits still stay in there and of

course the technology store those bits differently a hard drive has a magnetic

charge on a coated surface that had all sorts of crazy stuff going on uh a

flashlight that is a you know trapping a charge inside of a gate based on uh you

know transistor-like technology lots of details there which we won't get into

but basically the data is stored that's what we mean by persistence and so that

will be the third part of our class is understanding how all of that stuff

works another part of the operating system and that's why again the class is

about these three pieces virtualization concurrency and persistence because if

you understand all those things you understand all of the key things that

the operating system is involved with okay so

kind of what does that get us to be we said well what is

an os

well an os is sometimes people say is it provides a

virtual machine

which is really what that the idea of there is to make this whole system much

more easy to use it makes it so you can have as many programs running as you

want but they each have their illusions having their own cpu their own memory

they can access devices like hard drives and other things like displays easily

instead of knowing all the low-level yuckiness this easy-to-use virtual

machine and of course there's going to be many

issues that we address throughout the course

for example we even already talked about some of them like performance issues

and then of course what you might call security issues

like we want to make sure for example one program is running that it doesn't

have the ability to affect how other programs are relevant right into their

memories because we want to have this illusion that we have each program has

its own private machine that it's running on so often talk about

performance concerns how to do these things efficiently and we'll talk about

security of protection issues how to make sure that processes aren't messing

with other processes unless we want them to be able to and so we'll talk about

that in a great deal of detail as the semester goes on

so let's go all the way back to the beginning of this long-winded

class let's briefly talk about how does this

class work i'll copy this because i seem to like

doing this copy so

and you can see that i have to yet learn that i can use more than one color

but that's life and i don't know where to paste yet okay

how does this class work well for this piece i think the easiest

thing to do is to look at the web page

let's do that let's do that

let's do this let's look at that this is a web page

before there was canvas before there were all these other horrible tools that

we're all forced to use we just had these things

but in any case what this is this very thing simple thing that i've been doing

for a thousand years because i'm old is a rough schedule of what we're doing in

this class it shows the topics you're covering you

can see little numbers by each of the topics like each row as three and one

and two those are these two book chapters which you might read for

example after class or if you're a very enterprising student before class

um and then you ask questions from the chapter like you and everyone's like how

does that person know so much and it's because you read the chapter before

class i realized that i was an undergrad that some kid was doing this and the

teacher loved it so frustrating i'm like he just read the

book and then he's just asking you to look

good in front of everybody but it somehow is effective so if you do it

i'll be like that's amazing but i know the trick at least

okay so that's what we're going to cover that

orange stuff is that's virtualization we're talking about virtualized cpu in

memory the middle sub whatever color it is

bluish that's concurrency so we're going to talk about threads and how we create

them and locks and these other things called conditioned variables and center

forwards all cool etc

and then the last part in green that's

so all pretty cool we have a bunch of work to do let's look

at the by the way i realized that i used to just put these links up and say go

read them and then i realized most people don't so then we're just going to

do that together instead now i won't make you read it all but the overview

says hey this is what this course is about

one thing it says is where there's a bunch of material

there's a book i'm a co-author of and it is free

how awesome is that answer awesome you're welcome so um

the book chapters

amazing what coordination

in orange virtualization

in is uh persistence and then yellow is the

preface kind of stuff and then actually there's some tendencies and

stuff like that i think the security security was written by a different

author at ucla who just liked the book and said

here are some security chapters i wrote in the style of your book and i said

great let's put on the web page so

um the book is completely free you don't have to buy it if you buy great thank

you for buying it but you know that's fine

and it's uh as always they you know i've been a little honestly a bit behind on

updates because i have this like fourth job that i'm doing right now

some of you may know that because i sent emails saying like blah blah blah about

whatever which you ignore because you never read my emails

which i understanding of um

so that's fine but in any case i'm a little behind on updates but these

chapters get updated all the time they're always gonna this book will

always be free and so you can just use it to your heart's content fantastic

um so that's the book

um of course you have to do some other stuff like learn you have to be able to

do c there's lots of free online resources of course there's a classic uh

kernham and richie book k and r people call it that's where i learned c from

it's the c book written by the people who

invented c as well as unix i mean this is a an accomplished group

and it's i definitely recommend that book or at least um you know some sort

of resource like that there's some other cool books too which i list here there's

some other textbooks which i list which are just other books

of course this book exists because i didn't you know we didn't really like

those books so it's a little bit of a non-endorsement but there's some newer

books that are actually quite good too and if you're interested

so how's class going to work well mostly stuff will be on piazza and canvas and

the ta slashers

so anyway we're going to do that you can chat with each other about stuff don't

do weird stuff on it otherwise we won't have a discord anymore

that's one thing i can do i don't even know what discord is if somebody does

something weird on it we have to not have discord anymore

that will basically most of your grade will be

projects and exams projects

start basically after this class we'll talk about the first project in the

discussion

and then you can imagine looking for xp i'll call that one project

it's kind of like two of those uh this is good for your mentality if

it's one project but you know anyway that's worth those are there'll be some

number of those i'll lay them out over the coming weeks

there will be almost always there will be when there's a project

that's finished it'll be another project due not that far after that

the products will get harder over time and this is the theme of this class that

i'd like to share with you which is it always gets worse

it's a good thing to remember about this slice

it starts off bad and then it gets worse

so by the end you're like can you please stop assigning projects my answer to

that will of course be no and in fact every semester that i've

taught this class i've tried to make it even worse

because there's just so much to learn and you can cover so barely any of it in

this class so i always try to have more for you to do the reason we do projects

is because when you hear me talk you say oh yeah that makes sense and then when

you go to do it you realize you have no idea how to do it

so you're going to go and do these things that's how you learn right so my

apologies for that projects tend to be fun first few are on your own so that

kind of sticks you can of course talk to each other

like hey what are you doing for this whatever hey

but you can talk to each other be normal about it whatever but please don't do

things like copy copying by the way is really obvious when it happens because

it's impossible to write the exact same code for something it's just amazing

when you're writing like 100 lines of code no two people are going to generate

the same exact bugs this just doesn't happen

don't do it please don't make me deal with copying i hate dealing with copying

so that's the don't cheat so that's projects we'll have some exams the dates

are listed here the locations are not this will basically cover

gosh is that an exasperation already

you can't be exaggerated we just started you cannot be upset already

like this should not be a surprise to anyone that we have exams in this class

dude okay dude

so yes we're gonna cover virtualization and have an exam we're gonna cover

concurrency and have an exam and then we have a final exam now right now there's

a great controversy on piazza what day is the final exam when i log in

it says and then when students log into

something it's some other day i have no idea why we will get it figured out

mostly it'll be the date that i say right because that's probably what makes

sense you should show up like when i say the exam is not what some student does

you can hear the trucks outside by the way is it so awesome that there's

literally there's an exit right outside right there i'm excited by that

um i did not know that this room is very exciting to me now okay so that's most

of it projects

throughout the semester and they tend to be a little bit

cumulative right so that's the nature of it

um we also have this one thing which i'm doing just a weekly canvas quiz because

mostly students are like can you just give me more to do

can you give me more to do i love this class so much

and i

now these canvas weekly quiz things are going to be really easy but they'll just

be like a single question about what we talked about this week why is that there

to make sure you don't say you know i'm going to catch up on all this in six

weeks because when you do that the class goes badly for you so just another force

of function right my apologies for that

that's some basics about class what other things are going to happen

about class i've already talked about all these things more or less we'll have

handouts we'll put the videos of this up um we will have those homeworks this

actually just lists all the homeworks that are in the book they're not

homeworks you have to do the quizzes will be very simple

exams to test the knowledge in here projects the types of knowledge of the

project the discussion and of course those are linked right

it's not always perfectly linked for that my apologies but the projects trail

a little bit of what we're doing in class right

okay so that's how this class works and if

you're curious about how it works read the web page

web page what a terrible note that is finally

okay so back to the beginning we're now

almost at the end of class thursdays are going to be brutal because

we only have a 15 minute break

so my apologies for that but we're going to do it today we learned a couple

things we learned i am me and you are you

we learned how computers work isn't that fantastic

it fetches instructions and executes them out of memory etc

we learned what is an operating system kind of

it's this thing that makes a computer easy to use it makes a virtual machine

all sorts of tricks we're going to learn all those tricks and at the end of this

class you're gonna have an appreciation for this big mystery that about how

computers work they didn't used to know that's the fantastic thing about

computer science education to some extent there are these big amazing

things people have figured out over time you get to learn pieces of it and

eventually kind of stitch it all together the first people figured out

how to take transistors and simple switches and turn it into a process that

excuse instructions that's amazing

and we do it a billion times per second or more

operating systems people figured out how to take a single machine and turn into

many virtual machines compiler people figured out how to take

a language that we can look at and understand and turn into the code that

the machine understands and execute it's fantastic and each piece of computer

science is like that so take as many database classes you get

to learn how to go from sql queries these declarative statements to you know

these amazing results out of the database right

so all sorts of cool pieces take as many of them as you can we're going to learn

about this one key piece the operating system

we talked a little bit about how this class works

and then the final thing i'll just say this part we call

final words so the final words here i will just say

um this when i was a student i had a 28 year of

class my view was i was liking people in the back i would sit back and i'd leave

myself i absolutely never asked a question once

as an undergrad never once

which is a bit funny then like

this is the first time you teach a class what happens is people ask questions

and when people ask a question what you realize is you weren't explaining

something that well there's a misunderstanding

and then you the next time you do it you do it better

and you realize as a teacher eventually that the class is the interaction

between the students and the teachers it's not just the teacher talking and

the students listening it's the student's thinking and the students

asking and then the teacher responded so you made a class now i'll tell one

quick story last story and then we'll end

is the story of why we have this free book why do i just free book

i didn't i never noticed but it seems like an act of incredible

um

who knows

so how did a book exist a book started because

i was teaching this class my wife and i kind of rotated through this we had a

sense of what we wanted to do in the class over many years here probably

eight years and then but we always required some

other textbook after class one day

over in 1325 actually when this class

50 people a student came up to me and said do i

have to

[Music]

but i said why and the student said and of course i'll never forget that the

students said well i can't really afford it

and i was like i was how can i not be thinking about

that that i'm forcing you to do a live book that they may or may not be able to

afford

i felt funny so in fact i went to class the next day and i said we will never

require a textbook in this course again fantastic classes

take notes i'll take you know i'm writing the board you take notes it'll

work out three weeks later a different student

came by and said to me

hey i wonder what you're doing no textbook

but sometimes

and i said yes so at that point what i started doing is

just taking the text that would have been electric

vehicles

soon it started giving me all this positive feedback

about the class

absolutely

is

thank you for that it's like an unexpected applause line i

love that so thank you now we take a break till seven and we come back and do

it again
